                            <p>We've been taking time off to work on personal issues in our lives, but we've been missing Dungeonomics so much that we are going to slowly get back into updating the site. We have a long list of recommendations from everyone and have really appreciated all the feedback. We're back at it now and would love to interact with all of you. I'm going to be working on an in-house forum for Dungeonomics to better open lines of communication with you all. In the meantime, feel free to talk with us on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dungeonomics/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>. I check it almost every day and love to hear from everyone. Thanks for being so patient with us!</p>

                            <p>We've changed the layout of the homepage so we can deliver news and updates to everyone better than we have been. There have been several new updates to the site that we're excited about. We recently added the D&D SRD monsters and NPCs to Dungeonomics, and also added a "locations" section so you can build worlds/cities and tag them throughout your campaign.</p>
                            <p>We're going to continue adding updates to the site, but on a new schedule. We have been dying to work on a new site that is inspired by D&D but a very different experience. However, when we released Dungeonomics, we received such a large amount of positive feedback that we decided we had to continue working on it longer. Now that we've added a majority of the features requested, we are going to shift our focus to this new site we have been discussing for awhile. Instead of actively developing new features on Dungeonomics, we'll be actively developing this new site. For Dungeonomics, we are going to lean on community GitHub contributions; we are also going to take several opportunities each month to review the most requested features and implement them. With this new schedule, we are going to move from actively working on Dungeonomics to simply completing the most requested features. It's a small change, but worth noting. We're really excited about the new site and hope to share more information as we begin developing it.</p>
                            <p>To be clear, we are still going to be working on Dungeonomics. We use it personally, too, and love creating new features based on community feedback. You can always reach us at <a href="mailto:dungeonomics@gmail.com">dungeonomics@gmail.com</a> or on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dungeonomics/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> and we actively monitor both. Please feel free to reach out to us for suggestions, issues, or if you want to contribute to us via <a href="https://github.com/brunosardinepi/dungeonomics" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

                <h1>Streamlined Roleplaying</h1>
                <p>Dungeonomics is a place where DMs can manage their campaigns without the hassle of sifting through a mountain of paper. DMs control all aspects of their campaign from plot creation and setting up encounters to looking up/creating monsters or NPCs.</p>

                <p>Just so we're clear, we believe that there's no substitute for the real thing. Getting together with other adventurers in person will always be the best way to play D&D. Our goal is to enhance that and make it easier for you to immerse yourself in the game by eliminating the need to flip through a bunch of papers, which can sometimes pull you out of the experience.</p>

                <p>Now, go forth and create! Also, please come check us out on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dungeonomics/" target="_blank"><strong>Reddit</strong></a> or <a href="mailto:dungeonomics@gmail.com"><strong>email us</strong></a> to give us feedback and to receive updates.</p>
