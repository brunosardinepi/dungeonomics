                        <p>Hey everyone! It's 11/09/2017 and I just wanted to chime in and give y'all an update about the site. I'm currently focused on work and haven't had time to work on Dungeonomics. I still have a list of things I want to accomplish, it's just not something I have the time for at the moment.</p>
                        <p>I get regular emails from users and I take notes on your feedback, and I appreciate the kind words you all have. I especially appreciate the donations that help me pay for the servers to keep this running. I check back in every few days and it surprises me to see the user count steadily growing. I'm humbled by the extremely nice things you continue to send me and I will do my best to continue taking your feedback and advice so that when I do have the time to get back into it, I can properly adjust based on what the community wants.</p>
                        <p>I'm going to keep the site up as long as possible. While it's not even close to the dream I had for it, I believe it still serves a purpose based on the feedback I've gotten from everyone. Even if it isn't perfect, I hope it helps some of you and makes your lives a bit easier.</p>
                        <p>Feel free to send me an <a href="mailto:dungeonomics@gmail.com">email</a> any time. I'm usually quick to respond and like hearing from everyone.</p>

                        <h1>Streamlined Roleplaying</h1>
                        <p>Dungeonomics is a place where DMs can manage their campaigns without the hassle of sifting through a mountain of paper. DMs control all aspects of their campaign from plot creation and setting up encounters to looking up/creating monsters or NPCs.</p>
                        <p>Just so we're clear, we believe that there's no substitute for the real thing. Getting together with other adventurers in person will always be the best way to play D&D. Our goal is to enhance that and make it easier for you to immerse yourself in the game by eliminating the need to flip through a bunch of papers, which can sometimes pull you out of the experience.</p>
                        <p>Now, go forth and create!
